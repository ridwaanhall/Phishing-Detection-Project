## Project Board - Step by Step in 3 months

project is about **Phishing Domain Detection** using **Machine Learning Technology** in the domain of **Cyber Security**. The document outlines the problem statement, the approach, the evaluation metrics, the submission requirements, and the dataset link for your project.

To start the project in 3 months, you can follow this tentative plan:

- **1st month**: Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, and Feature Engineering
    - Explore the given dataset and understand its structure, distribution, and characteristics.
    - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, and errors.
    - Engineer new features based on the four categories mentioned in the document: URL-Based, Domain-Based, Page-Based, and Content-Based.
    - Save the cleaned and feature-engineered data for further analysis and modeling.
- **2nd month**: Model Building, Model Testing, and Model Optimization
    - Try out different machine learning algorithms that are suitable for the classification task, such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, etc.
    - Evaluate the performance of each model using the metrics specified in the document, such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, etc.
    - Select the best model based on the evaluation results and optimize it by tuning the hyperparameters, applying regularization, or using ensemble methods.
    - Test the optimized model on unseen data and measure its response time and latency.
- **3rd month**: Solution Design, System Architecture, and Deployment
    - Create the high-level document, low-level document, architecture document, and wireframe document for your project, following the sample links given in the document.
    - Expose your complete solution as an API or create a user interface for your model testing, using any cloud platform or edge device of your choice¹[1].
    - Implement logging for every action performed by your code and use AI ops pipelining for project delivery, if possible.
    - Record a project demo video and write a detailed project report, following the sample links given in the document²[2].
    - Post your project detail on LinkedIn and submit all the required links and documents in your dashboard³[3].
